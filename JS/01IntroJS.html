    <h1>JS Intro</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>
    <p>
      JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled)
      programming language with first-class functions
    </p>
    <p>JavaScript is event based programming language</p>
    <p>JavaScript is Synchornous Single Threaded programming Language</p>
    <p>
      The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual
      machine”.
    </p>
    <p>Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.</li>
      <li>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.</li>
      <li>
        …There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”,
        “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
